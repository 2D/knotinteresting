/*
In this example, the smart contract defines structures for Bitcoin transactions and room utilizations. 
The recordUtilization function records room utilization data, and the recordBitcoinTransaction function 
records Bitcoin transactions. You would need to modify and expand this contract to handle the actual 
linkage between Bitcoin transactions and room utilization data using appropriate identifiers.

To deploy and interact with this contract, you can use the Remix IDE or other Ethereum development tools. 
You would deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain, and then you could call the functions to record 
Bitcoin transactions and room utilizations.

Keep in mind that this example is very basic and lacks many real-world considerations, such as security, 
data validation, access controls, and more. Additionally, handling Bitcoin transactions on Ethereum 
requires integration with external data sources or oracles to verify Bitcoin transactions on the Bitcoin network.
