# Shor's Algorithm and Its Practical Implications

## Overview

This repository provides an introduction to Shor's Algorithm, a quantum algorithm with the potential to factor large composite numbers exponentially faster than classical algorithms. Shor's Algorithm is particularly relevant in the context of quantum computing and its implications for cryptography.

## Shor's Algorithm

### What is Shor's Algorithm?

Shor's Algorithm is a quantum algorithm designed to factor large numbers efficiently. It utilizes quantum properties, such as superposition and entanglement, to find the prime factors of a composite number faster than classical algorithms.

### How Does It Work?

Shor's Algorithm consists of several steps, including choosing a random integer, calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD), performing quantum operations to find the period of a function, and checking the result to identify factors. A simplified Python implementation is provided in this repository.

## Practical Implications

### Cryptography

Shor's Algorithm poses a significant threat to classical public-key cryptographic systems, like RSA and ECC, which rely on the hardness of factoring large numbers. In a post-quantum world, these encryption methods could be vulnerable.

### Security Assessments

Organizations and governments are actively assessing the impact of Shor's Algorithm on their existing cryptographic systems. Understanding the potential risks is essential for data security.

### Cryptographic Research

Ongoing research in post-quantum cryptography aims to develop encryption methods that are secure against quantum attacks, ensuring data security in the future.

### Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)

Quantum Key Distribution leverages quantum principles to establish secure communication channels, even against quantum attacks like Shor's Algorithm.
