"""
This code is a high-level representation of Shor's algorithm in Python. 
However, the specific part of the code that implements the quantum operations to find the period 
(the find_period function) is a placeholder and cannot be executed on a classical computer. 
It would require a quantum computer or quantum simulator.

Running the quantum part of Shor's algorithm requires usage of a 
quantum programming framework such as Qiskit (for IBM Quantum devices) 
or Cirq (for Google's Quantum devices) that interfaces with real quantum 
hardware or quantum simulators. These frameworks provide the necessary 
tools to define and run quantum circuits on quantum computers.

To experiment with Shor's algorithm on real quantum hardware or 
simulators requires to write the quantum part of the code using 
one of these quantum programming frameworks. 
The quantum part of the algorithm involves creating quantum circuits and 
using quantum gates to perform operations like quantum Fourier transform 
and modular exponentiation, which are the core components of 
Shor's algorithm.
